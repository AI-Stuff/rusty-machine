# RustyCollaborativeFilter
Online Collaborative Filter implemented in Rust

## Implementation

This project is implemented using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Motivation

This key motivation behind this project was for me to learn some systems programming and a new language! I wanted to try implementing a linear algebra library within a systems programming language and then extend this to explore some machine learning algorithms.

It is somewhat likely that when this project is finished I will convert it into a machine learning crate for Rust - providing I haven't done a completely terrible job.

## Current Progress

Working on the linear algebra library that will power the collaborative filter. Once this implemented the core algorithm should be easy to add on.

Based on the following paper:
